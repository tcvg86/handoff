## Flask
If you start Flask and you keep getting a CORS error, you need to clear you cookies and perform a hard refresh in your browser so that this works... otherwise, you're going to run into CORS issues that will make you scream.

## Secrets
You need to create a secrets file on your own to include your DB creds. You can also do whatever you want to do to make this better. This isn't a real project, just something to do to keep the mind sharp.
